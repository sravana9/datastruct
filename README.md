# Data structures

**Data structure** is a particular way of orgainsing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.    
For a good programmer the knowledge of data structures is must.
Based on the organisation of the data, data structure is classified as linear and non-linear.  
_Linear data structure_- If the data is organised in a linear order, then that data structure is called linear data structure.  
_Non-linear data structure_- If the data is organised in a hierarchical way i.e non-linear way, then that data structure is called non-linear data structure.  
Types of linear data structures:  
_Array_- An array is a collection of similar data elements, stored at a particular memory location.  
_Linked lists_- A linked list consists of nodes, that are stored at non- contiguous memory locations, such that each node consists the address of the next adjacent node.
Types of linked lists are: single linked list, double linked list and circular linked list.  
_Single linked list_- Each node has two parts, first part contains the data and the next part contains the address of the next adjacent node. The address of the last node consists of null, which signifies the last node of the single linked list.  
_Double linked list_- Each node consists of three parts, first part contains the address of the previous node, middle part consists data and the next part contains the address of the adjacent node. The previous part of the header consists null, which indicates the starting node and the next part of the last node consists null.  
_circular linked list_- A circular linked list can be implemented with both single linked list and double linked list. The last node of the CLL consists the address of the first node.  
Types of non-linear data structures:  
_Trees_- Data in organised in a hierarchical way, that consists of root node, non -
leaf nodes and leaf nodes.  
_Graphs_-Graphs are pictorial representation of data that are connected with the edges.
